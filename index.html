  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p>For those who love the outdoors, Sheffield is a truly incredible place to be. Half of the city’s population live within 15 minutes walk of open countryside and it's only a 20 minute drive from the city centre to the heart of the Peak District National Park. Visitors are well served by a variety of beautiful locations such as the Botanical Gardens, a haven of unparalleled tranquility just outside the town centre. In the Peaks, there is Stanage Edge, a climber’s paradise, offering breathtaking views for those skillful enough to traverse the treacherous terrain. Spaces like these are so important to the culture of our city and with many more experiences awaiting you, in and outside of Sheffield, here you can explore some of the must-visit locations it has to offer .</p>

<h2>The benefits of green spaces</h2>

<p><em>A 20-year-old University of Sheffield History student spoke to us about her personal experience with the city’s green spaces and told us why they are particularly special to her. She asked to remain anonymous but her story demonstrates the real value that these open spaces have to Sheffield and its residents. She told us: </em></p>

<p> "It’s difficult to pinpoint, but I’ve suffered from anxiety for around six years now. It all began in an exam during my GCSE’s, and one panic attack is all it took.</p>

<p> From then on, I associated more and more day-to-day activities with anxiety. It spread from the exam hall, to assemblies, to bus journeys, to simply walking down my street.</p>

<p> Whenever I found myself in a situation where it would be slightly difficult for me to leave, or get away, it would start to kick in. It begins with the shaking, then the sickness, the feeling that my heart might just burst out of my body.</p>

<p> When I came to Sheffield, the thought of starting University terrified me. The first few weeks were a massive struggle. I had to manage these feelings whilst also making new friends and going out all the time.</p>

<p> I took a walk in Weston Park one day when things were really bad, and I remember an instant sense of relief. Within minutes, I was away from the industrial city and into my own calm green space.</p>

<p> It felt like I was in a different city all together.</p>

<p> It’s so nice to be able to be in a relaxing space within minutes, and to be able to just sit and take a time-out from studying. Especially in the Spring and Summer, Sheffield’s parks are beautiful.</p>

<p> Whenever things build up and I reach that level of stress again, I take a breath and go for a walk round one of Sheffield’s green spaces. It’s nice to step away sometimes and be in your own little bit of heaven."

<h2>Top 5 places to visit</h2>

<p>

</p>

<h3>Botanical Gardens</h3>

<p>Arguably the most beautiful green space in the city of Sheffield, the Botanical Gardens seems a world apart from the industrial heart of the city. Despite being only a ten minute walk away, this tranquil spot transports you to a world of peace and nature, where even the keenest botanist will have their hands full with over 5,000 different species of plants to view. Famous for the Grade II* listed glass pavilions which house many exotic wonders, the park also contains more eccentric features like a bear pit which seems to be of particular interest to local children. The main view of the pavilions from the path is one of Sheffield’s most iconic images and no budding photographer should leave without capturing it. A visit to the park would not be complete without heading down to Ecclesall Road after for some high-quality refreshment.</p>
<p>Travel: The park is just off Ecclesall Road or can be reached at Clarkehouse Rd, Sheffield S10 2LN.</p>

<h3>Devonshire Green</h3>
<p>As the largest green space in the city centre, Devonshire Green sits proudly on the edge of Sheffield’s trendy Devonshire Street and is a hotspot for people enjoying the incredible food and drink the area has to offer on a pleasant day. For fans of extreme sports there is skatepark filled with skateboarders and BMX riders the whole year round and is simply a riveting watch for those who prefer to sit on the sidelines. The green has also served as the main stage for Sheffield’s renowned Tramlines festival in the past and will this year host BRIT-award winners Catfish and the Bottlemen and Dizzee Rascal among others. </p>
<p> Travel: The park is a two minute walk from town or can be reached at Devonshire St, Sheffield S3 7SW. There is a car park attached.</p>

<h3>Crookes Valley Park</h3>
<p>Located on the other side of Weston Park, Crookes Valley is dominated by its famous lake which serves budding fishermen and even, in warmer weather, brave swimmers! Families will find the play park and open areas of green space of interest, whereas those looking for refreshment should check out the Dam House above the park which offers a variety of alcoholic and soft drinks. It is a Sheffield tradition to sit on the sloping lawns of the Dam House with a drink in hand on a summers evening. If one desires a visit in the cooler months then it is well worth considering the Bonfire Night celebrations in which the firework display is famous throughout South Yorkshire. </p>

<p> Travel: The park is a five minute walk from town and around two minutes from the University of Sheffield Students’ Union. It can be reached at Crookes Valley Rd, Sheffield. </p>

<h3>Weston Park</h3>
<p> Situated in the heart of the City’s University area, Weston Park is well known for its vibrant flower displays and open recreational areas. It is not uncommon to see games of football, ultimate frisbee or even tennis on a sunny day! Opened in 1875 the park contains a number of memorials to poet Ebenezer Elliott, the York and Lancaster Regiment and more, giving it historical significance. Also of note is the Weston Park Museum, a Grade II* listed building inside the park which contains an exceptional archeological exhibition and is a previous winner of The Guardian’s Family Friendly Museums award.</p>

<p>Travel: The park is just across the road from the University of Sheffield Students’ Union or can be reached at Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TP. </p>

<h3>Peak District National Park</h3>
<p>A short 20 minute drive or bus ride from the city centre will take you into the very heart of the Peak District which comes as a shock to many visitors. Such a trip will reward you with views of rolling hills, clean fields and breathtaking rock formations; blink and you could be in New Zealand or Wales! For our guide and in the interests of covering a 555 mile radius, we have singled out Stanage Edge as our place to go due to its accessibility to anyone to experience the incredible views for themselves. It is not uncommon to see tourists carrying food to the top so they can enjoy a meal to remember watching the sun set over the hills. Just make sure to bring a map or sat-nav because phone signal is non-existent! </p>

<p>Travel: There are a variety of ways to get there; the Hope Valley train between Manchester and Sheffield stops on the way at villages in the Derwent, Hope and Edale valleys. The 65 bus in Sheffield goes to Buxton, stopping off at the historic plague village of Eyam, Tideswell – the Cathedral of the Peak, and Millers Dale. Drivers can get to Stanage Edge at Hathersage, Derbyshire, S33 1BR. </p>
